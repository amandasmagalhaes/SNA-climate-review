For each city, we examined daily mortality in relation
to hot weather using Poisson generalized linear models,
allowing for over-dispersion.
Weekly reports of laboratory-based influenza A activity also were adjusted for in the case of
London. We used indicator variables to allow for any day-
of-week or public-holiday effects. Cubic smoothing splines
of time with equally spaced knots were used to control for
secular trends (eg, demographic shifts) and any additional
confounding by seasonally-varying factors other than temper-
ature. Seven degrees of freedom (df) per year for these
smoothing splines (roughly equivalent to a 2-month moving
average) were used.21 This number of degrees of freedom
was chosen as a compromise between providing adequate
control for unmeasured confounders and leaving sufficient information from which to estimate temperature effects. Plots of partial autocorrelation suggested that this left approxi-
mately uncorrelated residuals. The same confounder control
(including the same amount of seasonal control) was con-
ducted on each series, although sensitivity of the estimates to
the degree of seasonal control was also examined.

simple linear threshold models, that is, models that assume a

For apparent temperature, single day lags of  0–3  days  were  applied,  as  well  as  cumulative  lags up  to  the  previous  week  (lags  0  through  6)  using  a moving  average.  We  also  investigated  multiple  susceptibilities  by  stratification  (e.g.  effect  of  education on heat-related mortality within the older age group).We present results based on the change in mortality risk  for  given  percentiles  of  the  city’s  own  temperature   distribution.   This   accounts   for   differences   in effects  for  a  specific  temperature,  which  vary  by  the city’s  climate.  In  other  words,  what  constitutes  a  hot day  in  one  city  with  respect  to  health  may  be  a moderate  temperature  elsewhere.

Pollution  variables  were  acquired  from four monitors in Mexico City, seven in Sa ̃o Paulo and eight in Santiago.

Data were originally  collected  from  death  certificates,  which  include date  and  cause  of  death,  age,  sex  and  educational attainment.  Age  was  categorized  as  0–15,  16–64  or565  years,  or  missing.  Educational  attainment  was assessed   for   those521   years   as   none,   primary, secondary,   university   degree   or   missing.   Due   to variation in educational categories and coding systems by  city,  educational  attainment  could  not  be  identically  classified  across  cities.  Primary  education  corresponds to 1–6 years in Mexico City and Santiago and1–7  years  in  Sa ̃o  Paulo.  Secondary  education  corresponds to 7–11 years in Mexico City and Santiago and8–11  years  in  Sa ̃o  Paulo. Cause  of  death  included  all  non-accidental  mortal-ity,   which   excluded   International   Classification   of Diseases  10th  Revision  (ICD 10)  Codes  S  and  above; respiratory   mortality   (ICD 10   Chapter   J   100–118,120–189,  209–499  and  690–700);  and  cardiovascular mortality    (ICD    10,    Chapter    I    <800).    Data    for December   31,   2002   was   omitted   for   analysis   of Mexico  City  as  administrative  irregularities  resulted in   an   unusually   low   mortality   count   on   this   day(55  deaths  compared  with  an  average  188.2  deaths/day  on  other  days).",Yes,"To  choose  the  appropriate  ozone  and  PM10lags,we  first  included  pollution  variables  in  the  model individually  at  single  day  lags  of  0–2  days  (Supplementary  Figures  S1  and  S2).  Same-day  ozone  expo-sure  showed  the  strongest  association  for  all  cities. For  PM10,  lag  1  was  strongest  for  Santiago  and  lag0 for Sa ̃o Paulo and Mexico City. We chose those lags for pollution adjustment in subsequent analysis; in all cases,  the  chosen  lags  exhibited  the  highest  effect estimates  and  smallest  variance. We then compared the association between weather and mortality with and without pollution adjustment. Table 2 shows the increased risk in all-cause mortality at  the  95th  percentile  of  same-day  mean  apparent temperature  compared  with  the  75th  percentile  for each  city,  with  varying  degrees  of  pollutant  adjustment.  For  all  cities,  effect  estimates  for  weather  and mortality  were  reduced  when  pollution  was  included in the model, for either PM10or ozone, either individually  or  simultaneously.  Reductions  were  more  dramatic  for  ozone  in  Santiago,  for  which  ozone  and mean   apparent   temperature   were   more   correlated than in  other  cities. The  reduction in  effect  estimates were   larger   with   PM10than   ozone   adjustment   in Mexico  City.  All  subsequent  models  adjust  for  ozone and  PM10.For apparent temperature, we considered single day lags   of   0–3   days   and   cumulative   lags   up   to   the previous  week.  Figure  1  provides  city-specific  results with  various  lag  structures  for  apparent  temperature. For single day lags (Figure 1a) of the same day up to3 days previous, the strongest association was for the same  day  for  all  communities.  For  cumulative  expo-sure  lags  (Figure  1b),  strongest  associations  were  for recent  days  of  exposure  and  generally  declined  as longer  lag  times  were  incorporated.  All  subsequent analysis  is  based  on  same  day  apparent  temperature. Changes  in  mortality  risk  based on  a  specific  temp-erature   increment   (e.g.   108C)   or   a   comparison   ofspecific  percentiles  (e.g.  95–75th  percentile)  provideinsight   into   only   a   portion   of   the   temperature-mortality  curve.  To  provide  a  more  complete  insight,we   generated   city-specific   non-linear   relationshipsbetween   apparent   temperature   and   mortality   risk(Figure  2).  While  risk  increases  with  rising  tempera-tures   in   all   cases,   each   community’s   curve   has   adifferent shape. The increase in mortality risk per unittemperature increase is higher for Sa ̃o Paulo as shownby  the  steeper  slope  on  the  right-hand  side  of  thecurve. The larger uncertainty for Santiago’s curve mayrelate  to  its  smaller  sample  size.  Note  that  the  mini-mum   mortality   temperature,   above   which   higherapparent  temperatures  are  associated  with  increasedmortality risk, also differs by city: 11.08C for Santiago,20.58C  for  Sao  Paulo  and  12.38C  for  Mexico  City.Table    3    compares    mortality    risk    at    the    95thand   75th   percentiles   of   apparent   temperature,   bycause  of  death,  sex,  age  and  educational  attainment.No  consistent  trend  was  observed  for  the  associa-tion    between    temperature    and    cause    of    deathacross cities.

Similarly, susceptibility by sex differed by community.While   effect   estimates   for   men   and   women   werecomparable  for  any  city,  associations  were  higher  formen  in  Santiago  and  Sa ̃o  Paulo  and  for  women  inMexico   City.   The   association   between   temperatureand  mortality  by  education  level  differed  by  commu-nity.  The  highest  effect  estimates  were  observed  forthe   most   educated   in   Mexico   City   and   the   leasteducated  in  Sa ̃o  Paulo.  Older  persons  were  consis-tently more susceptible. Trends in increasing risk withage were observed in all communities (SupplementaryFigure  S3),  and  effects  were  strongest  in  the  oldestage  category  (565)  in  Sa ̃o  Paulo  and  Mexico  City","High temperatures were associated with mortality risk in  the  Latin  American  cities  studied,  although  the nature  of  the  association  differed  by  city.

Those working outdoors are exposed to solar radiation, particularly in agriculture, construction, professional or domestic services (such as gardening), land transport, mining, and fishing.
Heat exposure has identified as an occupational health threat in sectors such as rice and sugarcane production in Central America, road-repair workers in Costa Rica.
Dehydration, due to profuse sweating and lack of rehydration, may be a factor in the kidney disease problems among some worker groups in Central American countries, like Nicaragua and El Salvador.
Indoor workers are also exposed, for example, “maquilas"", the food, beverage, and tobacco industry, as well as the metallurgy and metal product sectors.

Increased rest breaks could potentially cause income loss for workers.
More detailed occupational epidemiology research is needed to quantify the impacts in different locations and occupational groups.
Creation and implementation of new methods for cooling workplaces that do not require a major electricity supply will become increasingly important as climate change progresses.","Workplace heat is an important occupational health hazard in tropical countries, particularly for people working outdoors in the sun, and indoors in places without sufficient cooling.

An emergency was declared on the day of the flood. Among the 6,028 people living in a 94 km2 flood-affected area, 702 (11.7%) were placed in temporary evacuation centers set up in schools and sports fields. Rainfall levels returned to average rates around January 20th, and the emergency status was suspended on February 26.

Earthquake: On September 25th, 2005 at 8:58PM, a 7.0 Richter scale earthquake hit the town of Lamas, in the Peruvian department of San Martin. The earthquake killed five people and directly affected 10,082 people spread over a 35 km2 urban area in Lamas and smaller neighboring villages. Forty percent of the ~2500 households were destroyed and another 14% were severely damaged, resulting in the relocation of 1,635 individuals (16.2%) from the affected area to eight evacuation centers.Emergency status was declared and continued until November 2nd.

Volcanic activity: On March 27, 2006, the Ubinas volcano located in the Moquegua Department and the most active volcano in Peru, began to release a column of ash that could be seen 4 km away from the crater.  On April 6, the volcano increased the amount of released ash, which prompted the establishment of response activities and surveillance on April 10.  An explosion at the volcano ocurred on April 13, which was followed by emissions of ash, acids and sulfur affecting 4,599 inhabitants in a 14 km radius, and 854 people (18.6%) were relocated to two evacuation centers. An emergency status was declared for the period April 14–26. Surveillance continued through May 21st and the volcanic activity persisted until July 24th.","Infectious disease - other; Noncommunicable disease, including CVDs and respiratory disease; Mental health and cognitive function","Flooding: incidende rate of respiratory illness, diarrhea, psychologic disorders, injuries, wounds and trauma, conjunctivitis, skin infections, urinary tract infection, febrile.

The highest rate of consultations was observed during the volcanic event, followed by the flooding event and the earthquake.  The rate of medical consultations seen at the evacuation centers was higher at health facilities during both the flooding and volcanic activity. During the earthquake, however, evacuation centers reported a substantially higher rate of health visits, possibly as a result of damages to the health system infrastructure.

Acute respiratory infections were the most frequent cause of consultation (41% to 57%), and psychological distress was either second or third (8% to 14%), followed by injuries, conjunctivitis or diarrhea.

Outbreak of diarrheal disease at an evacuation center detected 12 d after the flooding, apparently due to poor-quality water. Another outbreak of gastroenteric disease was detected after the earthquake, apparently associated with the consumption of canned foods. Finally, an increase in the number of cases of respiratory cases and conjunctivitis was observed four days after implementing surveillance during the volcanic activity, possibly related to the inhalation of toxic gas and ash.

An emergency was declared on the day of the flood. Among the 6,028 people living in a 94 km2 flood-affected area, 702 (11.7%) were placed in temporary evacuation centers set up in schools and sports fields. Rainfall levels returned to average rates around January 20th, and the emergency status was suspended on February 26.

Earthquake: On September 25th, 2005 at 8:58PM, a 7.0 Richter scale earthquake hit the town of Lamas, in the Peruvian department of San Martin. The earthquake killed five people and directly affected 10,082 people spread over a 35 km2 urban area in Lamas and smaller neighboring villages. Forty percent of the ~2500 households were destroyed and another 14% were severely damaged, resulting in the relocation of 1,635 individuals (16.2%) from the affected area to eight evacuation centers.Emergency status was declared and continued until November 2nd.

Volcanic activity: On March 27, 2006, the Ubinas volcano located in the Moquegua Department and the most active volcano in Peru, began to release a column of ash that could be seen 4 km away from the crater.  On April 6, the volcano increased the amount of released ash, which prompted the establishment of response activities and surveillance on April 10.  An explosion at the volcano ocurred on April 13, which was followed by emissions of ash, acids and sulfur affecting 4,599 inhabitants in a 14 km radius, and 854 people (18.6%) were relocated to two evacuation centers. An emergency status was declared for the period April 14–26.

The highest rate of consultations was observed during the volcanic event, followed by the flooding event and the earthquake.  The rate of medical consultations seen at the evacuation centers was higher at health facilities during both the flooding and volcanic activity. During the earthquake, however, evacuation centers reported a substantially higher rate of health visits, possibly as a result of damages to the health system infrastructure.

Acute respiratory infections were the most frequent cause of consultation (41% to 57%), and psychological distress was either second or third (8% to 14%), followed by injuries, conjunctivitis or diarrhea.

Outbreak of diarrheal disease at an evacuation center detected 12 d after the flooding, apparently due to poor-quality water. Another outbreak of gastroenteric disease was detected after the earthquake, apparently associated with the consumption of canned foods. Finally, an increase in the number of cases of respiratory cases and conjunctivitis was observed four days after implementing surveillance during the volcanic activity, possibly related to the inhalation of toxic gas and ash.

Spearman’s rank correlations.
Monthly average correlation between climate and infections: the number of infections was negatively correlated with rainfall with a 2- and 3-month lag. There was also a negative correlation with the minimal temperature (2-, 3-, and 4-month lags) and a positive correlation with maximum temperature (3- and 4-month lags). No significant correlation was observed with the monthly average temperature.
Average annual correlation between climate and number infections: the number of annual infections were negatively correlated with rainfall, (P = 0.0018) No significant correlation was observed between temperature and the number of annual infections.

Study of time series: 
The study of time series with a monthly interval over the 1994–2010 periods shows a link between leishmaniasis and four of the climatic variables tested.
In the final model, the infections were negatively correlated with rainfall (with a 2-month lag) and with the number of days with rainfall > 50 mm (lags of 4 and 7 months). The variables that were positively correlated were temperature and the MEI index with lags of 8 and 4 months, respectively.

The cumulated rainfall were at a maximum in May (561 mm) and at a minimum in October (48 mm). The temperatures were at a maximum in October (32.5 °C) and at a minimum in September and October (22.4 °C).

Spearman’s rank correlations.
Monthly average correlation between climate and infections: the number of infections was negatively correlated with rainfall with a 2- and 3-month lag. There was also a negative correlation with the minimal temperature (2-, 3-, and 4-month lags) and a positive correlation with maximum temperature (3- and 4-month lags). No significant correlation was observed with the monthly average temperature.
Average annual correlation between climate and number infections: the number of annual infections were negatively correlated with rainfall, (P = 0.0018) No significant correlation was observed between temperature and the number of annual infections.

Study of time series: 
The study of time series with a monthly interval over the 1994–2010 periods shows a link between leishmaniasis and four of the climatic variables tested.
In the final model, the infections were negatively correlated with rainfall (with a 2-month lag) and with the number of days with rainfall > 50 mm (lags of 4 and 7 months). The variables that were positively correlated were temperature and the MEI index with lags of 8 and 4 months, respectively.

[11] that consists of maps depicting the geographical range of 115 triatomine species at a resolution of 1 : 3 700 000. 
To gather the required entomo-epidemiological information, we searched all relevant bibliographic sources (national and international journals, congress proceedings, university graduate theses, workshop summaries, and national and international reports on Chagas disease). Additionally, in the case of Venezuela, we used entomo-epidemiological information available from the database of the Ministry of Public Health of Venezuela (made available by staff members of the Directorate of Environmental Health, who participated in a preliminary analysis of this database [42,53]) covering a 16-year period (1990–2005). In the case of Argentina, because there is currently no centralized database equivalent to that of Venezuela, and data from various data sources in publications and reports were insufficient for model fitting, we additionally included some publications from neighbouring countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay).",Yes,"Local monitors (precipitation, temperature, air quality, other)",Yes,http://www.worldclim.org/,2000,Bioclimatic data layers [54] downloaded from WorldClim (http://www.worldclim.org/) were used as predictor variables to apply the climatic niche models to R. prolixus and T. infestans for current (average for 1950–2000) and 2050 (average for 2041–2060) conditions. ,Climate change - general (shift in overall temperature or precipitation patterns),"The most important bioclimatic factors for both species (after application of the Jackknife procedure) were mainly related to temperature and, to a lesser extent, precipitation. For R. prolixus, the most important variable was the minimum temperature of the coldest month, followed by isothermality, mean temperature of the driest quarter, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the wettest month, precipitation of the wettest quarter and annual precipitation. For T. infestans, the most important predictor variable was the mean temperature of the coldest quarter, followed by isothermality, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month.",Infectious disease - other,"to estimate the epidemiological implications in terms of projected changes in the FOI of Chagas disease, and its corresponding incidence changes, in Venezuela and Argentina.",Yes,"We used MaxEnt (v. 3.3.3k) [60] to predict the climatic niche for R. prolixus and T. infestans under current and future conditions.
Conversion from climatic suitability to the transmission risk of Tr. cruzi was through the FOI, which was undertaken via two methods: (i) a one-step approach directly relating suitability and FOI, and (ii) a two-step approach, which first relates suitability with household vector density, and then vector density with FOI.","Despite the heterogeneous results, our main conclusions point out a decreasing trend in the number of new cases of Tr. cruzi human infections per year between current and future conditions using a climatic niche approach.",Not found,Yes,Other: Rural population,"To estimate the expected number of new cases in 2050, we first linearly projected the current rural population (considered to be the more vulnerable population owing to the higher relative vector exposure compared with urban populations) by a demographic factor of 0.61 in Argentina [80] and 0.74 [80] in Venezuela.
Despite these heterogeneous results, our main conclusions point to a decreasing trend in the number of new human cases of Tr. cruzi infection per year between current and future conditions. However, it is important to be aware of recent (and ongoing) decreases in the size of the rural population; future demographic projections for rural populations in 2050 predict a decrease in size of 26% and 49% for Venezuela and Argentina [80], respectively. This implies that even if an FOI value remains constant between current and future scenarios, a decrease in incidence suggests a decreasing risk; however, this would lead to a false conclusion in the event of a decrease in the rural population size. For R. prolixus, our FOI estimates were of a similar order of magnitude as those previously estimated for Venezuela by Feliciangeli et al. [42] for the period prior to the initiation of the National Campaign for Chagas Disease Control. Our conversion from FOI to incidence could have been improved further by considering only susceptible individuals from the rural population. Additionally, we could also have separated ‘marginally dispersed’ and plain ‘rural’ populations as undertaken by Chuit [93] in relation to Chagas disease. However, these additional details would have taken us beyond the main purpose of this manuscript and are unlikely to have substantially affected the key qualitative conclusions drawn.",Not found,N/A,No,Neither/unclear,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

They modelled the association with temperature using a distributed lag non-linear model. This class of models can describe complex non-linear and lagged dependencies through the combination of two functions that define the conventional exposure-response association and the additional lag response association, respectively. The lag-response association represents the temporal change in risk after a specific exposure, and it estimates the distribution of immediate and delayed effects that cumulate across the lag period. Specifically, they modelled the exposure-response curve with a quadratic B-spline with three internal knots
placed at the 10th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of location specific temperature distributions, and the lag-response curve with a natural cubic B-spline with an intercept and three internal knots placed at equally spaced values in the log scale.

They used the fitted meta-analytical model to derive the best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative exposure-response association in each location. The best linear unbiased prediction represents a trade-off between the location-specific association provided by the first-stage regression and the pooled association. This approach allows areas with small daily mortality counts or short series, usually characterised by very imprecise estimates, to borrow information from larger populations that share similar characteristics.13,23,25 The minimum mortality temperature, which corresponds to a minimum mortality percentile between the fi rst and the 99th percentiles, was derived from the best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative exposure-response association in each location. They referred to this value as the optimum temperature, and deemed it the reference for calculating the attributable risk by re-centring the quadratic B-spline that models the exposure-response. For each day of the series, in each location, they used the overall cumulative RR corresponding to each day’s temperature to calculate the attributable deaths and fraction of attributable deaths in the next 21 days, using a previously described method.26 The total attributable number of deaths caused by non-optimum temperatures is given by the sum of the contributions from all the days of the series, and its ratio with the total number of deaths provides the total attributable fraction. They calculated the components attributable to cold and heat by summing the subsets corresponding to days with temperatures lower or higher than the minimum mortality temperature. They further separated these components into moderate and extreme contributions by defining extreme cold and heat as temperatures lower than the 2·5th location specific percentile (extreme cold) and higher than the 97·5th location-specific percentile (extreme heat). These cutoffs are consistent with previous definitions of extreme weather, such as heatwaves.7,14,18,19 They defined moderate temperatures as the ranges between the optimum temperature and these cutoffs. They defined other ranges using cutoffs at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles.

During2010-2011, a total of 7,415 dengue cases were recorded in the existing surveillance systems. Dengue cases were typically concentrated in areas with high LST, and the majority of cases (93%) occurred in areas with LST>28◦C; fewer cases occurred in slum-likeareas (Fig.1). Kernel estimation method showed that the highest densities of dengue cases occurred in the north, east, northeast, southeast, and southwest areas(Fig.2), withLSTranging30–34◦C (Fig.1A). 

Dengue incidence by territory 
The dengue incidence was higher in high LST areas in the overall city area (Fig.3,upperpanel), and in slum-like areas (Fig.3, middle panel). A similar result was obtained when the incidence was recalculated after excluding the slum-like areas from overall São Paulo area. However, in the20–24◦C temperature range a relatively high incidence was calculated because the population density in these areas was low (Fig.3, bottom panel). 

Dengue incidence by population density 
The analysis of dengue occurrence based on population density demonstrated that most cases were clustered in highly populated zones(Fig.4A), although the incidence (incasesper 100,000 individuals) was low in densely populated areas and relatively high in less-populated areas (Fig.4B). 

Dengue incidence by vegetation cover
The majority of dengue cases occurred in areas with low vegetation cover (Fig.5). Zones with high vegetation cover had the lowest incidence rate (3.2cases per 100,000 inhabitants), while the moderate and low vegetation zones had incidence rateso f50.2 and 72.3, respectively. Areas with high vegetation cover were cooler (26±2◦C) compared to areas with moderate or low vegetation cover (both,29±2◦C). 

Multiple cluster analysis 
MCA of the 96 ADs (Supplementary Information: Fig.S1, Tables S2 and S3) revealed a complex relationship between the incidence of dengue and the socioeconomic and environmental factors (Fig.6). In the phenogram, dengue incidence was clustered in high - LST areas (32–36◦C), while areas with LST<30◦C showed a relatively low similarity with dengue occurrence despite the presence of socioeconomic features in the low LST areas that potentially promote disease transmission, like low household income, high population density, and slum-like areas. As would be expected, the slum-like areas clustered with the lowest household income ranges. Areas with low vegetation cover clustered with higher LST(28–30◦C), while high vegetation cover clustered with lower LST (22–24◦C)(Fig.6), in agreement with results shown inFig.5C.

Dengue incidence by vegetation cover
The majority of dengue cases occurred in areas with low vegetation cover (Fig.5). Zones with high vegetation cover had the lowest incidence rate (3.2cases per 100,000 inhabitants), while the moderate and low vegetation zones had incidence rateso f50.2 and 72.3, respectively. Areas with high vegetation cover were cooler (26±2◦C) compared to areas with moderate or low vegetation cover (both,29±2◦C). 

Multiple cluster analysis 
MCA of the 96 ADs (Supplementary Information: Fig.S1, Tables S2 and S3) revealed a complex relationship between the incidence of dengue and the socioeconomic and environmental factors (Fig.6). In the phenogram, dengue incidence was clustered in high - LST areas (32–36◦C), while areas with LST<30◦C showed a relatively low similarity with dengue occurrence despite the presence of socioeconomic features in the low LST areas that potentially promote disease transmission, like low household income, high population density, and slum-like areas. As would be expected, the slum-like areas clustered with the lowest household income ranges. Areas with low vegetation cover clustered with higher LST(28–30◦C), while high vegetation cover clustered with lower LST (22–24◦C)(Fig.6), in agreement with results shown inFig.5C.

",Yes,,"Our results indicate that LST had the greatest impact on the incidence of dengue in São Paulo during 2010–2011, and support the hypothesis that the high temperatures found in UHI favors A.aegypti proliferation and increases blood feeding, there by increasing the incidence of dengue. We believe these results may be useful in designing public health strategies for dengue surveillance and prevention in areas similar to São Paulo. Therefore, green space expansion should be prioritized in urban planning, as it may reduce the adverse effects of UHI on human health if combined with continued efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites and increase public awareness of dengue transmission.

Detrending involves regressing the local time-series on multimodel global surface air temperature data from the Twentieth Century Climate in Coupled Models [28], and low-pass filtering. Decadal components are obtained via low-pass filtering of the residual, using an order-five Butterworth filter with half-power at a period of 10 years, while the inter-annual component is computed as the difference between the residual from the detrending step and the decadal signal [15]. By construction, the method identifies the long-term trend with the anthropogenic climate change signal. For additional details, see the IRI Timescale Decomposition Maproom [19].

and association with climatic variables
For the analysis, a protocol previously applied to study 
malaria in Panamá was followed [8]. Briefly, the pro-
tocol starts by inspecting the autocorrelation function 
(ACF), i.e., the time series correlation with itself through 
time, and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), 
i.e., the correlation between consecutive time lags [31]. 
With information about the significant time lags, a null 
autoregressive model with no covariates, was built. This 
null model was used to pre-whiten the time series from 
all covariates using the Kalman filter [31]. Pre-whitening 
is a process where any common autoregressive structure 
is removed from ancillary time series in order to study 
its patterns of association with a focal time series [31]. 
Residuals from the autonomous null model and pre-
whitened residuals from covariates were used to estimate 
cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of malaria incidence 
with each one of the covariates. The CCFs indicate lags at 
which malaria and the covariates were correlated, which 
were subsequently used to build models with covariates. 
The model that included all significant covariates was 
simplified by a process of backward elimination guided 
by the minimization of the akaike information criterion 
(AIC), a function that trades-off model goodness-of-fit 
and parameter number, and whose minimization can be 
used to select among models with a similar number of 
parameters [31]. For the best model error assumptions 
were verified using standard procedures for time series 
analysis

Non‑stationary patterns of association in the time–frequency 
domain
The association of cycles in time series over time can 
be studied using cross wavelet coherence analysis [33, 
34]. Here, wavelet-based analysis was used to determine 
at a particular frequency and time in Niño 4 index and 
malaria, and also to see if these time series were associ-
ated with climatic covariates, i.e., temperature and rain-
fall, and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of NDVI 
in Comarca Guna Yala
","onthly malaria cases in Guna Yala (1998–2016) were autocorrelated up to 2 months of lag, likely reflecting parasite transmission cycles between humans and mosquitoes, and cyclically for periods of 4 months that might reflect relapses of Plasmodium vivax, the dominant malaria parasite transmitted in Panamá. Moreover, malaria case  number was positively associated (P < 0.05) with rainfall (7 months of lag), and negatively with the El Niño 4 index  (15 months of lag) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI (8 months of lag), the sign and magnitude  of these associations likely related to the impacts of weather patterns and vegetation on the ecology of Anopheles  albimanus, the main malaria vector in Guna Yala.

Estimating anomalies in climate variables is a common method used to evaluate the impact of the El Niño–La Niña phenomenon. The procedure requires the estimation of a time span cumulative index that establishes a comparative relation between the cumulative value of rainfall during the time span of a significant cluster and the historic average value of that period.",Infectious disease - leptospirosis,"The cases of HL were supplied by the National Institute of Health of Colombia through the surveillance system (SIVIGILA), which is based on the compulsory notification from health care units, and it corresponds to the period from January 2007 to December 2016 for all municipalities in the country. 
A patient who has a fever and a headache associated with one or more of the following signs or symptoms—myalgias; conjunctival bleeding or conjunctivitis; prostration; skin rash; arthralgias; vomiting; nausea; jaundice; hepatomegaly; splenomegaly; oliguria; anuria; hemorrhages in the skin, mucous membranes or gastrointestinal tract; irritation; meningeal signs; confusion; psychosis; delirium; arrhythmias; heart failure; cough; hemoptysis; and/or respiratory failure.
Additionally, those patients who presented signs or symptoms of a non-specific infectious process with suggestive epidemiological antecedents in the 30 days before the date of onset of symptoms of the disease were included.
 These suspected cases were confirmed by one of the following laboratory criteria:•positive IgM antibody ELISA;•seroconversion in paired samples by micro agglutination(MAT);•MAT titers greater than 1:400;•isolation of Leptospiraspp. in blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid culture;•DNA detection by PCR.",Yes,"The SaTScan software was used to identify spatiotemporal clusters of leptospirosis. The statistic was configured to identify no overlapped clusters with high rates and to include a maximum of 50% of the population at risk in a cluster using a space–time permutation model with 9999 replicates. Statistically significant clusters were identified using a standard Monte Carlo technique with the inferred value of p<0.01. In a space–time permutation model, the number of observed cases in a cluster is compared with what would have been expected (i.e., if the expected number of cases in each municipality is proportional to its population size) if the spatial and temporal locations of all cases were independent of each other, so that there is no space–time interaction.  That is, there is a cluster in a municipality if, during a specific period, that municipality has a higher proportion of cases in that period compared with the remaining geographical areas.","The municipalities of El Cairo, Pueblo Rico, San Angel and Calarca (clusters C1, C2, C4 and C5, respectively) are not endemic areas; these municipalities presented no cases or a few cases, and only had an outbreak during the cluster period. In contrast, the municipalities of C6 in the Uraba region, particularly Turbo (Figure4H), experienced endemic behavior with oscillations during the time series.
In our case, the increase in HL cases across the country, and the increase of municipalities with at least one case observed between October 2010 and December 2011 corresponded to a weak episode of La Niña according to ONI, but the same tendency was not observed for the three other La Niña episodes in 2007–2008, 2011–2012 and 2016–2017.",N/A,No,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,Other: N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

These data have been used in previous single- or multicountry studies.",Yes,"They estimated the location-specific temperature-related mortality associations for each year of the series through quasi-Poisson regression and time-varying distributed lags non-linear models (DLNMs). This class of models can describe complex non-linear and lagged dependencies, through the combination of two functions into a cross-basis that define the conventional exposure-response association and the additional lag response association, respectively. We extended the methodology of the basic DLNMs, which assumes time-constant exposure-lag-response associations, to time-varying DLMNs by including a linear interaction between time and the cross-basis function defining the exposure-lag-response associations.
Specifically, the cross-basis function of daily mean temperature was composed of a natural cubic spline function for the temperature dimension with 3 internal knots in the 10th, 75th and 90th percentile of the location-specific temperature distributions, and a natural cubic spline with an intercept and 2 internal knots placed along equallyspaced values on the log scale, for the lag dimension. The lag period was extended to 21 days to capture the long-lagged associations and potential short-term harvesting. The chosen combination of nonlinear functions and knots provided the lowest quasi-Akaike score (Q-AIC), compared to alternative models (see Methods S1). A natural cubic Bspline function with 8 df per year of series of the time variable was included to control for long-term trends and seasonality, together with an indicator term for day of the week. We included in the model the interaction terms obtained by multiplying cross-basis variables and time. The selection of the model specifications was based on previous work using a similar dataset. They predicted the exposure-lag-response association for each of the years included in the study period, in each location by centering the time variable on the middle day (1st July) of the corresponding year.
Bi-dimensional spline functions estimated for each year were reduced to uni-dimensional overall cumulative exposure-response. This step reduces the number of parameters to be pooled in the second-stage meta-analysis, and preserves the complexity of the estimated dependency. They additionally estimated the average temperature-mortality associations over the whole study period in each location from the basic DLNMs, using models that do not include the interaction term.
Year-specific and average cumulative exposure-response associations estimated for each location were pooled through separate multivariate meta-analytical models of the first-stage coefficients. They included location-specific average and temperature range, and a categorical variable identifying each country as meta-predictors, to partially account for between-location differences in temperature-mortality associations. We derived the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of the overall cumulative exposure-response association in each location and year which will be used to estimate attributable risk in subsequent steps (see the section below).
To explore temporal changes in the association, they reconstructed the country-specific exposure–response shapes for the first and last year of each series, as described in a previous study. Heat- and cold-mortality associations for the two selected years were summarized by computing the RR at the 99th and 1st percentile, respectively, of the year-specific temperature distribution, using the year-specific minimum mortality temperature (MMT) as a reference (minimum mortality percentile (MMP) between the 50th and the 99th of the year-specific temperature distribution). Additionally, they formally assessed the temporal variation using the multivariate Wald test on the pooled interaction terms resulting from the reduced location-specific coefficients. The null hypothesis of the test is that none of the coefficients are different from 0, thus no temporal changes in the whole exposure-response curve are observed.
Yearly-attributable fractions (AFs) were estimated using the year-specific BLUPs in each location and aggregated by country, as described elsewhere (Gasparrini and Leone, 2014). Components attributable to cold and heat were computed by summing the mortality attributable to heat and cold on days where temperatures were lower or higher than the estimated optimal temperature, and then dividing by the total number of deaths in each year. Optimal temperature was represented by the location- and year-specific MMT, estimated from the corresponding BLUPs, defined between the 50th and the 99th percentiles of the year-specific temperature distribution. Yearly AFs estimates were additionally aggregated into 5-year sub-periods (1985–1989, 1990–1994, 1995–1999, 2000–2004, 2005–2009). As mentioned before, temporal variation in attributable risk is influenced by changes in the yearly temperature distribution (due to global warming), and by the temporal evolution of the temperature-mortality curves (due to changes in susceptibility to heat and cold). In order to disentangle the contribution of these two elements in defining the temporal trends in temperature-mortality impacts, they predicted the yearly-AF in each country using the procedure described above but in two different counterfactual scenarios, defined in terms of exposure-response functions and temperature distributions: (1) Temporal variation uniquely driven by changes in exposure-response association: we predicted yearly-AFs in each location and aggregated by country assuming a constant mean temperature distribution throughout the study period. They applied the city- and year-specific BLUPs (obtained using time-varying DLNMs similar to the original approach), but over the whole-period mortality-temperature series in each location, instead of each year-specific series. (2) Temporal variation uniquely driven by changes in temperature distribution: they assumed a constant exposure-response association across the study period, while allowing time-varying temperature distributions. In this case, they applied the average exposure-response association (common to all years and represented by the corresponding location-specific average BLUPs derived from the DLNMs without the interaction term), over the temperature-mortality series of each year of each location and predicted the corresponding yearly-AF in each location and subsequently aggregated by country. The comparison of the observed changes with those predicted in the two counterfactual scenarios above can help to determine the pace of potential changes in vulnerability to non-optimal temperatures, and help determine how much of these trends are explained by changes in temperature distribution. This can provide insights on the role of potential adaptive mechanisms in defining these trends, that is, either purely climate change adaptation or other attenuation mechanisms. For example, in the case of an absence of a changing climate (no changes in temperature exposure), a reduction in susceptibility would be entirely attributed to an attenuation of the effect due to non-climate driven mechanisms. Likewise, if the impact remains constant regardless of a shift towards warmer temperatures, this would suggest the presence of purely adaptation to a changing climate.","Heat-related AFs decreased in all countries (ranging from 0.45–1.66% to 0.15–0.93%, in the first and last 5-year periods, respectively) except in Australia, Ireland and UK. Different patterns were found for cold (where AFs ranged from 5.57–15.43% to 2.16–8.91%), showing either decreasing (Brazil, Japan, Spain, Australia and Ireland), increasing (USA), or stable trends (Canada, South Korea and UK).

Se eliminaron los registros correspondientes a causas externas de muerte (V00 a Z99) 14. Así, se creó una serie para la totalidad de las muertes por causas naturales definidas, ocurridas durante el período, a partir de la cual se generaron sub series con sexo, grupos de edad (seis categorías: 0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85 años y más, y se incluyó un sexto grupo que comprende a todos los mayores de 64 años) y cuatro causas principales de muerte: enfermedades del sistema respiratorio (códigos J00 a J 99), del sistema circulatorio (I00 a I99) y dentro de estas las causas cerebrovasculares (I60 a I69), y enfermedades del sistema genitourinario (N00 a N99).",Yes,"Las series y los modelos se trabajaron con el paquete “mgcv” del software R 3.4.2 (http://www.r-project.org), a partir de la fórmula estandarizada:log(E(Y)) = β0 + β1X1 + ...S1(X1) + ε

según la cual Y es el conteo diario de muertes, E(Y) es el valor esperado para el conteo de mortalidad, β0 es el intercepto, β1 es el estimador, X1 es la variable concomitante y S1 es la función de suaviza-miento. β1 expresa el aumento en la mortalidad en presencia de la variable explicativa ola de calor. Los resultados se expresan en términos de razón de riesgo (RR), definida como la diferencia entre casos de expuestos y no expuestos a la ola de calor, con la fórmula:RR = exp(β1)

Los modelos se construyeron en dos etapas, en la primera se dio cuenta del comportamiento temporal de las series (mes y día de la semana como variables dicotómicas y suavizamiento por ten-dencia de largo plazo), y en la segunda etapa se conservaron aquellas variables que mostraron una correlación significativa y se agregaron las variables meteorológicas (temperatura media y humedad) y de ola de calor, con un método de estimación quasi máximo verosimilitud o quasi-Poisson. Este modelo permite aislar el efecto propio de las olas de calor de aquel provocado simplemente por las temperaturas altas.","Analizando las muertes acaecidas durante los semestres cálidos del período, se observa que durante las olas de calor hay un incremento significativo en el riesgo de morir por causas naturales (RR = 1,140; IC95%: 1,108-1,173), mientras que la mortalidad atribuida al aumento simple en la tem-peratura media es de RR = 1,007; IC95%: 1,005-1,009, por cada 1ºC. La Figura 2 muestra los valores de RR para la mortalidad total y por grupos durante las olas de calor y sus respetivos rezagos. No se verificó la presencia de efecto cosecha, es decir, que no se encontró una disminución en el riesgo durante los días posteriores a los eventos; indicando que el aumento de muertes durante las olas de calor no constituye un adelantamiento de decesos inminentes. Por el contrario, tanto las mujeres, los adultos mayores (65 y más años y 85 y más años), como las causas cardiovasculares y respiratorias, alcanzan su riesgo relativo más alto el día posterior a la finalización de la ola de calor.El riesgo varía levemente según el sexo, siendo RR = 1,081; IC95%: 1,034-1,129 para mujeres y RR = 1,074; IC95%: 1,030-1,121 para los varones. Mientras que en los varones el mayor RR fue durante las olas de calor, para las mujeres el RR más alto (1,092; IC95%: 1,052-1,134) se alcanza al incluir también el día siguiente a la finalización de la ola, lo que implica que el efecto del calor sobre el organismo afecta a este grupo más allá de la finalización del evento.Las causas de defunción que mostraron un incremento significativo en el riesgo de morir fueron las cardiacas y las respiratorias. La mortalidad por causas cardiovasculares alcanza su RR más alto (1,112; IC95%: 1,059-1,168), si se incluye el día posterior a la finalización de la ola de calor, y las causas respiratorias lo hacen al segundo día de finalizada la ola (RR = 1,126; IC95%: 1,063-1,192). No se observó un aumento significativo en el riesgo de muerte por causas renales, ni cerebrovasculares, durante las olas de calor.

A esto se suma el hecho de que esta ola ocurrió tres días después de la finalización de otra ola más corta de cuatro días.El riesgo de morir durante la ola de calor de diciembre de 2013 se incrementó significativamente para la mortalidad general (total de causas naturales), pasando de un 14% más (en los días de ola de calor), a un 42,8% más que en cualquier otro día del semestre cálido. Además, el riesgo aumentado se mantiene con la inclusión de los cuatro días posteriores a la finalización de las olas como puede verse en la Figura 3.En cuanto al comportamiento por sexo, en las mujeres el mayor valor de riesgo relativo se registró incluyendo al día siguiente de la finalización de la ola (RR = 1,395; IC95%: 1,286-1,512), mientras que en los varones el pico en el RR se registró al cuarto día (RR = 1,275; IC95%: 1,184-1,373) (Figura 4).Al analizar los incrementos en el riesgo de morir por grupos de edad, todos presentan riesgo relativo incrementado significativamente. Particularmente, el grupo de 0-14 años pierde significancia con el rezago de 1 día, pero la recupera para los rezagos de 2 a 8 días, alcanzando su valor más alto en el día 7, posterior a la finalización de la ola, mientras que el grupo de 15-64 muestra incrementos significativos durante la ola de calor y con rezagos de 1 a 6 días. El mayor incremento en el riesgo de morir lo presentan los adultos de 85 y más años, quienes superan el 50% de aumento en la mortalidad durante la ola de calor y el día siguiente (RR = 1,515; IC95%: 1,372-1,674).El grupo de edad de 65-74 que no presentaba incrementos significativos en el riesgo de morir para todas las olas del período 2005-2015 presentó incrementos significativos en la ola de diciembre de 2013 (RR = 1,361; IC95%: 1,178-1,572).En cuanto a las causas de muerte analizadas, excepto el accidente cerebrovascular -que no pre-sentó correlación con esta ola de calor en ninguno de los rezagos analizados- todas ellas presentan un riesgo aumentado que se incrementa posteriormente a la finalización del evento. Las causas de defunción, debidas a problemas renales, no habían presentado sensibilidad a las olas de calor en su conjunto, pero al estudiar un evento extremo, como el de diciembre de 2013, se observó un incremen-to significativo en el riesgo de morir con pico máximo en el sexto día posterior a la finalización de la ola (RR = 1,647; IC95%: 1,367-1,986), tras el que pierde significancia estadística.

Se utilizaron series diarias de tempera-turas y humedad relativa, medidas en la Estación Central del SMN en Buenos Aires (Villa Ortúzar, 34º35’S, 58º26’O), y se construyeron dos variables dicotómicas, para la presencia o ausencia de ola de calor y para la presencia o ausencia de ola de calor extendida (la ola de calor de diciembre de 2013 fue la más extensa del registro histórico de la estación Central con una duración de 9 días y es proba-blemente atribuida al cambio climático 23,24).

",Mortality - heat or cold related,"Los datos de mortalidad para los años 2005 a 2015 fueron suministrados por la Dirección de Estadísticas e Información de Salud del Ministerio de Salud de la Nación. Las variables proporciona-das para cada caso de defunción fueron: causa de muerte codificada, según la décima revisión de la Codificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE-10), sexo, edad al momento de la muerte y lugar de residencia. Se eliminaron los registros correspondientes a causas externas de muerte (V00 a Z99) 14. Así, se creó una serie para la totalidad de las muertes por causas naturales definidas, ocurridas durante el período, a partir de la cual se generaron sub series con sexo, grupos de edad (seis categorías: 0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85 años y más, y se incluyó un sexto grupo que comprende a todos los mayores de 64 años) y cuatro causas principales de muerte: enfermedades del sistema respiratorio (códigos J00 a J 99), del sistema circulatorio (I00 a I99) y dentro de estas las causas cerebrovasculares (I60 a I69), y enfermedades del sistema genitourinario (N00 a N99).",Yes,"Las series y los modelos se trabajaron con el paquete “mgcv” del software R 3.4.2 (http://www.r-project.org), a partir de la fórmula estandarizada:log(E(Y)) = β0 + β1X1 + ...S1(X1) + ε

según la cual Y es el conteo diario de muertes, E(Y) es el valor esperado para el conteo de mortalidad, β0 es el intercepto, β1 es el estimador, X1 es la variable concomitante y S1 es la función de suaviza-miento. β1 expresa el aumento en la mortalidad en presencia de la variable explicativa ola de calor. Los resultados se expresan en términos de razón de riesgo (RR), definida como la diferencia entre casos de expuestos y no expuestos a la ola de calor, con la fórmula:RR = exp(β1)

Los modelos se construyeron en dos etapas, en la primera se dio cuenta del comportamiento temporal de las series (mes y día de la semana como variables dicotómicas y suavizamiento por ten-dencia de largo plazo), y en la segunda etapa se conservaron aquellas variables que mostraron una correlación significativa y se agregaron las variables meteorológicas (temperatura media y humedad) y de ola de calor, con un método de estimación quasi máximo verosimilitud o quasi-Poisson. Este modelo permite aislar el efecto propio de las olas de calor de aquel provocado simplemente por las temperaturas altas.","Analizando las muertes acaecidas durante los semestres cálidos del período, se observa que durante las olas de calor hay un incremento significativo en el riesgo de morir por causas naturales (RR = 1,140; IC95%: 1,108-1,173), mientras que la mortalidad atribuida al aumento simple en la tem-peratura media es de RR = 1,007; IC95%: 1,005-1,009, por cada 1ºC. La Figura 2 muestra los valores de RR para la mortalidad total y por grupos durante las olas de calor y sus respetivos rezagos. No se verificó la presencia de efecto cosecha, es decir, que no se encontró una disminución en el riesgo durante los días posteriores a los eventos; indicando que el aumento de muertes durante las olas de calor no constituye un adelantamiento de decesos inminentes. Por el contrario, tanto las mujeres, los adultos mayores (65 y más años y 85 y más años), como las causas cardiovasculares y respiratorias, alcanzan su riesgo relativo más alto el día posterior a la finalización de la ola de calor.El riesgo varía levemente según el sexo, siendo RR = 1,081; IC95%: 1,034-1,129 para mujeres y RR = 1,074; IC95%: 1,030-1,121 para los varones. Mientras que en los varones el mayor RR fue durante las olas de calor, para las mujeres el RR más alto (1,092; IC95%: 1,052-1,134) se alcanza al incluir también el día siguiente a la finalización de la ola, lo que implica que el efecto del calor sobre el organismo afecta a este grupo más allá de la finalización del evento.Las causas de defunción que mostraron un incremento significativo en el riesgo de morir fueron las cardiacas y las respiratorias. La mortalidad por causas cardiovasculares alcanza su RR más alto (1,112; IC95%: 1,059-1,168), si se incluye el día posterior a la finalización de la ola de calor, y las causas respiratorias lo hacen al segundo día de finalizada la ola (RR = 1,126; IC95%: 1,063-1,192). No se observó un aumento significativo en el riesgo de muerte por causas renales, ni cerebrovasculares, durante las olas de calor.

Leptospirosis is a seasonal disease in the region, the largest number of cases and outbreaks were recorded in seasons with warm and moderate temperatures (summer and autumn, see average temperatures in methods).
In Argentina, flooding events have emerged to be the major risk factor for leptospirosis.
These results suggest that the study region is highly vulnerable to leptospirosis outbreaks during EN years. Thus, the seasonal prediction of remote climatic forcing-factors such as El Niño can be a predictor of possible outbreaks of leptospirosis in the study region.
Hydroclimatic indicators vary in different spatial scales.

This study does not analyze suspected and unconfirmed cases",Yes,"The PCA indicates that the ONI index, the hydrometric level and monthly total precipitation are highly correlated with the outbreaks in the cities and with the number of cases of leptospirosis (r > 0.76)","Hydroclimatic indicators (monthly total precipitation, monthly river hydrometric level and Oceanic Niño Index) associated with outbreaks of leptospirosis vary in different spatial scales (provincial, departmental and cities).
Leptospirosis is a seasonal disease in the region, the largest number of cases and outbreaks were recorded in seasons with warm and moderate temperatures (summer and autumn, see average temperatures in methods).
In Argentina, flooding events have emerged to be the major risk factor for leptospirosis.
These results suggest that the study region is highly vulnerable to leptospirosis outbreaks during EN years. Thus, the seasonal prediction of remote climatic forcing-factors such as El Niño can be a predictor of possible outbreaks of leptospirosis in the study region.
Hydroclimatic indicators vary in different spatial scales. At a provincial scale the ONI Index seems to indicate the highest incidence of leptospirosis, at a departmental scale both the ONI Index and precipitation could be indicators of outbreaks, and at an even more local scale the ONI Index, precipitation and hydrometric level in riverside cities could be considered to predict the occurrence of outbreaks. Outbreaks occurrence are favored by the rainy season and warm. These findings demonstrate that leptospirosis should be considered as a regional issue given the actual hydroclimatic features (humid and warmer conditions, most frequent extreme precipitation events and most severe floods of recent years) and the topographic characteristics of NEA",NA,No,N/A,N/A,Our findings can provide useful inputs to epidemiological models of leptospirosis that are mainly used to monitor and predict the behavior of the disease in the short to medium term. ,N/A,No,Other: N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

As with many other pilot projects, the small sample size limits the statistical power of any comparisons that are made. For recruitment purposes, we relied heavily on the assistance of the farm doctors and engineering teams to recruit participants for the study, making the sample recruitment partially driven by convenience. Additionally, some of the recruitment took place by word of mouth from worker to worker. This may have biased the type of workers that were included in the study. The heat
assessment may have been strengthened by the following: measuring heart rate throughout the day to be able to calculate the PSI; asking about caffeine, diuretics, acetaminophen, and alcohol consumption;
and measuring workers’ pre- and post-shift body weight. As mentioned previously, the metabolic rate and clothing ensemble estimations used in the WBGT calculation rely on subjective observations made
by the research team; future endeavors should include an objective measure of energy expenditure, such as a continuously monitoring accelerometer or heart rate monitor. Unfortunately, we did not include the rate of temperature rise and response to rest in this manuscript as individual workers were
not observed the entire duration of wearing the sensor. Therefore, we did not have a concrete record of their periods of rest and work. We hope to include this data collection and analysis in future endeavors.

The mortality rate ratio index (hereafter OE ratio) was computed using the averaged period proportional mortality ratio, a commonly used methodology for analyzing excessive mortality data.
Regarding daily values of Tmax and Tmin, a weighted arithmetic mean was performed between the values recorded for Galeão and Santos Dumont stations in order to better quantify a more realistic heat stress scenario for the MRRJ. The arithmetic mean was computed conceding more weigh to Galeão temperature values (80%) given its more central interior localization within the MRRJ comparing to Santos Dumont station (20%).
Daily mortality values were comparedtoTmax,dailymean temperature (i.e., average between Tmax and Tmin, hereafter Tmean) and EHF values. The singularity of the EHF parameter is related to its ability to quantify the heat stress conditions during a specific day inserted within a 3-day long hot period and so to better describe the impacts of heat-related events on human mortality during HWs.
We have adopted the daily EHF index from Nairn (2009) that incorporates two different components, a short-term and a long-term effect. The short-term component value—EHI (sig), is computed based on a running 3-day-averaged Tmean, which accounts for the current day and the two previous ones, defining a time window of possible excess heat accumulation. This excess heat accumulation is afterward quantified by the difference between the averaged Tmean value computed for this 3day time window and a climatological reference threshold (95th percentile of the PDF of daily Tmean—hereafter T95).
Accordingly, and following previous analysis, HW events are defined as periods of three or more consecutive days characterized by daily EHF values above zero. In order to limit our analysis to the most extreme HWevents (see the “Assessment of the mortality rates in HW events” section), we choose to consider only the periods marked by consecutive days with EHF values above the climatological (1961–2015 base period) calendar day 90th percentile calculated on a 15-day window (centered on the day in question).
Several approaches have been proposed to estimate the relative risk of death (RR) in relation to temperature. Poisson regression is one of the most adopted methods for rare count events given its efficiency, intuitive methodology, and its capability for estimating the relative risk. In order to surpass the overdispersion problem, generalized linear models are computed, where the most common approach is a “quasi-likelihood” with Poisson-like assumptions (Quasi-Poisson) or a negative binomial regression model that has been applied to both morbidity and mortality studies (Ver Hoef and Boveng 2007; Charkha et al. 2013; Ardiles et al. 2017).

","Results showed that the highest absolute mortality values during heat-related events were linked to circulatory illnesses.

In the first stage, they used a time-stratified case-crossover design to evaluated the heat–hospitalization association for each city. QuasiPoisson regression with a distributed lag model was used to estimate the city-specific association.
They used a linear function for the temperature–response dimension, and a natural cubic spline with 3 degrees of freedom for the lag–response dimension along 0–7 lag days. In the second stage, they pooled the city-specific estimates for all cities or cities in different socioeconomic groups (Q1–Q4 of each socioeconomic indicator, or classification according to the World Bank), using a random effect meta-analysis with maximum likelihood estimation.
This provided us a pooled estimation of the heat–hospitalization association at the national level and within different socioeconomic levels. Based on 1,814 city-specific effect estimates, we used random effect meta-regression with each socioeconomic variable (including literacy rate, urbanization rate, household income, and log-transformed GDP per capita) as the only meta-predictor to test whether the city-level heat–hospitalization association was significantly modified by each city-level socioeconomic variable. To capture any potential nonlinearity in the meta-regression, we tried to add each socioeconomic variable to the metaregression model as a natural cubic spline function with 2 to 4 degrees of freedom. However, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values of nonlinear models were generally larger than or close to the BIC value of the linear meta-regression model.
They used the linear meta-regression model throughout the analyses. They stratified all the analyses above by sex, 4 age groups (0–19 years, 20–39 years, 40–59 years, 60 years or above), and 16 specific causes of hospitalization. The heat–hospitalization association was reported as the cumulative relative risk (RR) of hospitalization (with 95% CIs) over lag 0–7 days associated with every 5˚C increase in daily meantemperature during the hot season. The increased hospitalization risk associated with every 5˚C increase in daily mean temperature was then calculated as 100% × (RR − 1).
They performed 2sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. First, they tested whether the socioeconomic disparities in heat vulnerability remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders in the meta-regression. For each socioeconomic indicator in the random effect meta-regression model, they adjusted for city-specific mean temperature in the hot seasons, temperature range (maximum temperature minus minimum temperature in the hot seasons), and the ratio of young population (0–19 years) and elderly population (60 years or above), as an indicator of population structure. Second, they repeated the above analyses based on 1,723 cities with relatively small population sizes (ranging from 8,014 to 243,270), after excluding cities with population sizes larger than the 95th percentile of all 1,814 cities. Compared to large cities, the city-level socioeconomic indicators in those small cities could be more representative of the residents’ true socioeconomic situations.","They found that less developed cities showed higher increased all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization than more developed cities when exposed to the same temperature rise during the hot season.
For cities of lower middle income (LMI), upper middle income (UMI), and high income (HI) according to the World Bank’s classification, every 5˚C increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI 4.4%–5.7%, P<0.001), 3.7% (3.3%–4.0%, P <0.001), and 2.6% (1.7%–3.4%, P<0.001) increase inall-cause hospitalization, respectively. The inter-city socioeconomic disparities in the association were strongest for children and adolescents (0–19 years) (increased all-cause hospitalization risk with every 5˚C increase [95% CI]: 9.9% [8.7%–11.1%], P < 0.001, in LMI cities versus 5.2% [4.1%–6.3%], P < 0.001, in HI cities). The disparities were particularly evident for hospitalization due to certain diseases, including ischemic heart disease (increase in cause-specific hospitalization risk with every 5˚C increase [95% CI]: 5.6% [−0.2% to 11.8%], P = 0.060, in LMIcities versus 0.5% [−2.1% to 3.1%], P = 0.717, in HI cities), asthma (3.7% [0.3%–7.1%], P=0.031, versus −6.4%[−12.1% to −0.3%], P=0.041), pneumonia (8.0% [5.6%–10.4%], P<0.001,versus 3.8% [1.1%–6.5%], P =0.005), renal diseases (9.6% [6.2%–13.1%], P < 0.001, versus 4.9% [1.8%–8.0%], P = 0.002), mental health conditions (17.2% [8.4%26.8%], P <0.001, versus 5.5% [−1.4% to 13.0%], P =0.121), andneoplasms (3.1% [0.7%5.5%], P =0.011, versus −0.1% [−2.1% to 2.0%], P =0.939). The disparities were similar whenstratifying the cities by other socioeconomic indicators (urbanization rate, literacy rate, andhousehold income). The main limitations were lack of data on personal exposure to temperature, and that our city-level analysis did not assess intra-city or individual-level socioeconomic disparities and could not exclude confounding effects of some unmeasured variables.
These inter-city socioeconomic disparities in associations of heat with health outcomes were particularly notable for hospitalizations of children and adolescents, and for hospitalizations due to ischemic heart disease, asthma, pneumonia, renal diseases, mental health conditions, and neoplasms.","city-specific mean temperature, temperature range, and the ratio of elderly population (>60 years) and young population (0–19 years)",Yes,N/A,"Most hospitalizations due to cerebrovascular diseases (mainly stroke) and heart failure happened in elderly people, especially those living in LMI cities.

The increased hospitalization risk associated with every 5˚C increase in daily mean temperature was then calculated as 100% × (RR − 1).
They performed 2sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. First, they tested whether the socioeconomic disparities in heat vulnerability remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders in the meta-regression. For each socioeconomic indicator in the random effect meta-regression model, they adjusted for city-specific mean temperature in the hot seasons, temperature range (maximum temperature minus minimum temperature in the hot seasons), and the ratio of young population (0–19 years) and elderly population (60 years or above), as an indicator of population structure. Second, they repeated the above analyses based on 1,723 cities with relatively small population sizes (ranging from 8,014 to 243,270), after excluding cities with population sizes larger than the 95th percentile of all 1,814 cities. Compared to large cities, the city-level socioeconomic indicators in those small cities could be more representative of the residents’ true socioeconomic situations.","They found that less developed cities showed higher increased all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization than more developed cities when exposed to the same temperature rise during the hot season.
For cities of lower middle income (LMI), upper middle income (UMI), and high income (HI) according to the World Bank’s classification, every 5˚C increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI 4.4%–5.7%, P<0.001), 3.7% (3.3%–4.0%, P <0.001), and 2.6% (1.7%–3.4%, P<0.001) increase inall-cause hospitalization, respectively. The inter-city socioeconomic disparities in the association were strongest for children and adolescents (0–19 years) (increased all-cause hospitalization risk with every 5˚C increase [95% CI]: 9.9% [8.7%–11.1%], P < 0.001, in LMI cities versus 5.2% [4.1%–6.3%], P < 0.001, in HI cities). The disparities were particularly evident for hospitalization due to certain diseases, including ischemic heart disease (increase in cause-specific hospitalization risk with every 5˚C increase [95% CI]: 5.6% [−0.2% to 11.8%], P = 0.060, in LMIcities versus 0.5% [−2.1% to 3.1%], P = 0.717, in HI cities), asthma (3.7% [0.3%–7.1%], P=0.031, versus −6.4%[−12.1% to −0.3%], P=0.041), pneumonia (8.0% [5.6%–10.4%], P<0.001,versus 3.8% [1.1%–6.5%], P =0.005), renal diseases (9.6% [6.2%–13.1%], P < 0.001, versus 4.9% [1.8%–8.0%], P = 0.002), mental health conditions (17.2% [8.4%26.8%], P <0.001, versus 5.5% [−1.4% to 13.0%], P =0.121), andneoplasms (3.1% [0.7%5.5%], P =0.011, versus −0.1% [−2.1% to 2.0%], P =0.939). The disparities were similar whenstratifying the cities by other socioeconomic indicators (urbanization rate, literacy rate, andhousehold income). The main limitations were lack of data on personal exposure to temperature, and that our city-level analysis did not assess intra-city or individual-level socioeconomic disparities and could not exclude confounding effects of some unmeasured variables.
These inter-city socioeconomic disparities in associations of heat with health outcomes were particularly notable for hospitalizations of children and adolescents, and for hospitalizations due to ischemic heart disease, asthma, pneumonia, renal diseases, mental health conditions, and neoplasms.","city-specific mean temperature, temperature range, and the ratio of elderly population (>60 years) and young population (0–19 years)",Yes,N/A,"Most hospitalizations due to cerebrovascular diseases (mainly stroke) and heart failure happened in elderly people, especially those living in LMI cities. This might explain the unexpected inter-city socioeconomic disparity pattern in heat vulnerability for elderly people.","The findings could still be quite relevant for adaptation policy at the state or national level, in terms of allocating resources between cities to deal with the increasing heat exposure under global warming.

",Extreme temperatures - heat,"Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) has been  well tested and used in  the development of suggested occupational work-rest cycles to prevent heat injury among outdoor workers [26]. Following methods we have previously described [27], we calculated the average daily WBGT (WBGTmean)and the maximum daily WBGT (WBGTmax) during the hours of 7:00–17:00 using data from the ElBalsamo weather station (14.28N, 91.00W, 280 m above sea level). The cutting groups rotate throughnumerous plantations, ranging from sea-level to 500 m, throughout the Department of Escuintla.The choice of the El Balsamo weather station was made since: (1) it lies along the central border of thefield range; (2) is within approximately 21,600 m of the majority of fields; and (3) is at an altitude of280 m, the average altitude found for all fields.",Other: Occupational injuries,"The primary outcome of interest was the total number of recorded occupational injuries amongsugarcane  harvesters  per  day.   This  included  injuries  in  the  following  categories:  falls,  hit  by  afalling object, slips, caught or stuck between an object, strains or sprains, exposure to extreme heat(non-ambient such as steam),  exposure to electrical current,  exposure to a harmful substance orradiation, chemical accidents, cut with an agricultural tool, vehicular accidents, bites from snakes orinsects, agricultural incidents, or other. Secondary outcomes included the total number of recordedoccupational injuries specific to cuts with an agricultural tool, falls, and slips given the hypothesizedmechanism of association with heat exposure [15].Information on dehydration was recorded starting with the 2016–2017 season.   Prior to the2016–2017 season, the company had not considered dehydration as a reportable incident.   As anadditional analysis, we examined the total number of confirmed dehydration cases per day for the2016–2017 and 2017–2018 harvests. Dehydration was self-reported by the workers to the field nursesbased on symptoms of headache, weakness, and nausea and was clinically confirmed by medical stabased on urinary specific gravity reading of>1.020 prior to being recorded.",Yes," Functional form of the Relationship between WBGT and Occupational InjuryPrevious studies examining the association between WBGT and health outcomes have suggestedthat the appropriate functional form may take on a U-shape or other non-linear relationship indicatingthat both extreme cold and extreme heat are risk factors for morbidity and mortality [31]. Given theWBGT ranges observed in Central America [25],  extreme cold is not a concern currently in thispopulation. Nevertheless, we assessed correlation plots between WBGT and reported count of injuries and fit a smoothed spline for each of the four harvests independently to understand if similar non-lineartrends were present at the extreme temperatures experienced by our study population.

Regression ModellingAs the outcome was count data, we considered a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poissondistribution for the outcome and a log link function. We also considered a zero-inflated Poisson modelto account for the potential of excess days where the recorded injury count was zero. To determinethe appropriate assumption, we ran both models examining total recorded injury count on centeredWBGTmeanwhile adjusting for total number of workers and harvest year. All harvests were includedin the regression models. A Vuong test [32] was used to compare the models.We confirmed our visual conclusion regarding the functional form of WBGT by running the GLMdescribed above with the addition of a quadratic term for centered WBGTmean.  We compared themodels with and without this additional term using a likelihood ratio test.To create our final model for analysis, we added the additional covariates of acclimatization periodindicator (first 2 weeks of harvest vs.  rest of harvest) and average daily tons cut to the appropriatemodel with the correct functional form for centered WBGTmean.  We ran the multivariable modelsindependently for the three outcomes of interest: total daily recorded occupational injuries, total dailyrecorded cut, slips, and fall injuries, and total daily confirmed dehydration cases. All statistical analyseswere conducted using R version 3.6.1 [19].

Sensitivity AnalysesTo test the sensitivity of our conclusions to the choice of WBGT summary statistic, we re-ranthe  multivariable  model  for  total  daily  recorded  occupational  injuries  with  centered  WBGTmax.To understand the stability of the estimates to selection of weather station, we re-ran the multivariablemodel for total daily recorded occupational injuries using data from the Cengicaña weather station(14.33N, 91.05W, 300 m above sea level).

The majority of the occupational injuries recorded were cuts by an agricultural tool,falls, or slips (N=163; 81%), with a vast proportion of these from being cut by an agricultural tool(N=111; 68%). For the years in which dehydration data were collected, it was recorded twice as oftenas any other occupational injury (Table 1).

The  estimated  annual  total  recorded  injury  rate  was  1.84  per  100  workers  for  2014–2018.The  estimated  annual  rate  for  dehydration  was  1.57  per  100  workers  for  2016–2018.

During the validation process, in a first stage, in the case of values that are statistically different from those expected values at a given time and location (errors and outliers) are also identified and removed. Therefore, to identify outliers, a temporal outlier detection method was applied. It compares various function curves at fixed time periods, so functional outliers detection is used to compare entire vectors of measurements (e.g., all observations in a month). In addition, a spatial outlier detection method was applied, in which an observation is compared to the observations in its spatial neighborhood. In a second stage, all data were subjected to analysis, excluding data from monitoring stations with less than 75% of complete data for at least one pollutant during the study period. Missing values were generated using the MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) multiple imputation method and the NIPALS (Nonlinear estimation by Iterative Partial Least Square) approach using XLSTAT.
Air quality was assessed by comparison with current national standards, and the Friedman test was used to determine if there were significant differences in mean concentrations for criteria air pollutants among different municipalities.

",Yes,"A Poisson regression model was constructed according to methodology described by APHEA(Air Pollution and Health: A European Approach) and EMECAM (Spanish Multicenter Study on Relationship between Atmospheric Pollution and Mortality) projects, applying a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), self-correlation functions between residuals and cross-correlation to all study variables (for each cause of death and for each pollutant).
From the basal model, an equation was obtained to determine the magnitude of the association between daily mortality and the variation of the average daily levels of atmospheric pollution, by using the same methodology reported by Cerón et al.
The selected variables to be included in the basal model were those that contributed in a significant way to the variability of the dependent variable (daily mortality). This procedure was applied considering all causes, age group and specific cause of death. The manifestation of the effects of atmospheric pollution on daily mortality is not immediate, it is necessary to consider lag periods (presumably short). To decide the lag term in the daily mean values for temperature and relative humidity, it was necessary to perform an analysis of cross correlations for data series: daily mortality vs. daily mean temperature, and daily mortality vs. daily mean relative humidity. Later, the most statistically significant lags were selected (if the regression coefficient showed p < 0.10). In this way, when such variables were introduced to the Poisson model, Pearson residuals were reduced (residual autocorrelation), and it was manifested in the function of simple autocorrelation. Therefore, meteorological variables were lagged by up to 7 days selecting those more significant. In the cases in which the independent variables significantly influenced the response variable (for a 95% confidence interval and p < 0.05), this effect was evaluated by the beta coefficient (β) of each independent variable. From the base model, the β coefficient values were obtained and used to estimate the relative risk indexes (RRI) as reported by Cerón et al.
The next step was to generate different scenarios in which atmospheric pollutants concentrations increased by 10% (one-at-a-time and keeping the remaining variables unchanged), obtaining β and RRI values for daily mortality attributed to respiratory, circulatory, and all causes (>60 years). ","Most of pollutants and municipalities showed a great number of associations between an increase of 10% in their current concentrations and mortality, especially for people >60 years. Different scenarios resulting from climatic change were built (increases of 5–25% in daily mean temperature), but only the increase of 25% (5 °C) showed a significant association with air pollutant concentrations and mortality. All pollutants and municipalities showed significant increases in relative risk indexes (RRI) resulting from an increase of 5 °C when people >60 years was considered. Results were comparable to those reported by other authors around the world. The RRI were low but significant, and thus are of public concern. ","Temperature and relative humidity were used as confounding variables considering two study cases. The first, to assess the effect of a future increase of air pollution in MAM on daily mortality, with scenarios in which daily concentrations for criteria air pollutants were increased by 10%. The second, a climatic change scenario in which the response to atmospheric pollution was modified by high temperatures considering a susceptible population sub-group (over 60 years).

During the validation process, in a first stage, in the case of values that are statistically different from those expected values at a given time and location (errors and outliers) are also identified and removed. Therefore, to identify outliers, a temporal outlier detection method was applied. It compares various function curves at fixed time periods, so functional outliers detection is used to compare entire vectors of measurements (e.g., all observations in a month). In addition, a spatial outlier detection method was applied, in which an observation is compared to the observations in its spatial neighborhood. In a second stage, all data were subjected to analysis, excluding data from monitoring stations with less than 75% of complete data for at least one pollutant during the study period. Missing values were generated using the MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) multiple imputation method and the NIPALS (Nonlinear estimation by Iterative Partial Least Square) approach using XLSTAT.
Air quality was assessed by comparison with current national standards, and the Friedman test was used to determine if there were significant differences in mean concentrations for criteria air pollutants among different municipalities.

Health effects survey: 2010",Climate change - general (shift in overall temperature or precipitation patterns),"We used the scenarios of climate change estimated for Mexico and reported in the
Climate Action Plan of the State of Nuevo León [27]. The A1B and A2 scenarios were devel-
oped for Mexico using a resolution of 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ for four periods of three decades each to
estimate changes in maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. The A1B Sce-
nario describes the possible growth of a world with rapid economic growth, demographic
growth with stabilization of the population growth by the second half of the century, and
technology-based efficiency in human living, with balanced fossil and non-fossil energy
sources. The A2 scenario describes self-reliance and preservation of local identities, unequal
fertility rates but with variables increasing in the global population, unequal and variable
productivity-dependent economic development, and a slow introduction to more efficient
technologies [28].
The four periods covered were from 1980 to 2009, from 2010 to 2039, from 2040 to
2069, and from 2070 to 2099. The data of each scenario represents the probable changes of
temperature and precipitation for the central decade and were named as the 1990s scenario,
the 2020s scenario, the 2050s scenario, and the 2080s scenario, respectively. We downscaled
the scenarios to a 5 km × 5 km grid to obtain higher resolution data for each three-
decade period. We performed downscaling correlating scenario data of temperature and
precipitation with historical data obtained from 118 climate meteorology stations within
and surrounding the state of Nuevo León. We used the Lars—WG model to generate time
series of minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation for the different
periods of 1990s, 2020s, 2050s and 2080s for the two scenarios, A1B and A2. The ArcMap
co-kriging statistical method was used to interpolate these variables. The variables used
in the interpolation included the annual average readings of climate variables in each
climate season, but also the specific altitude, exposure orientation, and distance to sea.
The resulting interpolation layer was transformed to a RASTER format with a cell size
of 5 km × 5 km. We prepared maps of temperature and precipitation for each of the
three-decade periods considering the A1B and A2 scenarios.
We used the data of the high resolution grid to calculate the difference between the
base data (period of the 1990s) and the estimated climatic change and pluvial precipitation
in the next three-decade periods. The results show an expected temperature and pluvial
precipitation change in the order of 0.51–1.5 ◦C and 6% respectively for the decades of 2010
to 2039. In the decades from 2040 to 2069 (the 2050s), the expected temperature change will
be in the order of 1.01–1.50 ◦C with little change in pluvial precipitation. By the 2070 to 2099
decades (2080s), the expected temperature increase will be in the range of 2.01–2.50 ◦C. The
pluvial precipitation expected to increase in the range of 0.1 and 2% in the A2 scenario and
in the range of 6.1 a 10% in the A1B scenario [28]. For geodesic interpolation, we selected a
0.5◦ × 0.5◦ screen using the co-kriging geo-statistical method. Socio-demographic, climatic
and seasonal variations, exposure vectors, and distance from the sea were incorporated in
the calculations [29]. (Figure 2) In order to study the present and future effects of global

Health effects survey: 2010",Climate change - general (shift in overall temperature or precipitation patterns),"We used the scenarios of climate change estimated for Mexico and reported in the
Climate Action Plan of the State of Nuevo León [27]. The A1B and A2 scenarios were devel-
oped for Mexico using a resolution of 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ for four periods of three decades each to
estimate changes in maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. The A1B Sce-
nario describes the possible growth of a world with rapid economic growth, demographic
growth with stabilization of the population growth by the second half of the century, and
technology-based efficiency in human living, with balanced fossil and non-fossil energy
sources. The A2 scenario describes self-reliance and preservation of local identities, unequal
fertility rates but with variables increasing in the global population, unequal and variable
productivity-dependent economic development, and a slow introduction to more efficient
technologies [28].
The four periods covered were from 1980 to 2009, from 2010 to 2039, from 2040 to
2069, and from 2070 to 2099. The data of each scenario represents the probable changes of
temperature and precipitation for the central decade and were named as the 1990s scenario,
the 2020s scenario, the 2050s scenario, and the 2080s scenario, respectively. We downscaled
the scenarios to a 5 km × 5 km grid to obtain higher resolution data for each three-
decade period. We performed downscaling correlating scenario data of temperature and
precipitation with historical data obtained from 118 climate meteorology stations within
and surrounding the state of Nuevo León. We used the Lars—WG model to generate time
series of minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation for the different
periods of 1990s, 2020s, 2050s and 2080s for the two scenarios, A1B and A2. The ArcMap
co-kriging statistical method was used to interpolate these variables. The variables used
in the interpolation included the annual average readings of climate variables in each
climate season, but also the specific altitude, exposure orientation, and distance to sea.
The resulting interpolation layer was transformed to a RASTER format with a cell size
of 5 km × 5 km. We prepared maps of temperature and precipitation for each of the
three-decade periods considering the A1B and A2 scenarios.
We used the data of the high resolution grid to calculate the difference between the
base data (period of the 1990s) and the estimated climatic change and pluvial precipitation
in the next three-decade periods. The results show an expected temperature and pluvial
precipitation change in the order of 0.51–1.5 ◦C and 6% respectively for the decades of 2010
to 2039. In the decades from 2040 to 2069 (the 2050s), the expected temperature change will
be in the order of 1.01–1.50 ◦C with little change in pluvial precipitation. By the 2070 to 2099
decades (2080s), the expected temperature increase will be in the range of 2.01–2.50 ◦C. The
pluvial precipitation expected to increase in the range of 0.1 and 2% in the A2 scenario and
in the range of 6.1 a 10% in the A1B scenario [28]. For geodesic interpolation, we selected a
0.5◦ × 0.5◦ screen using the co-kriging geo-statistical method. Socio-demographic, climatic
and seasonal variations, exposure vectors, and distance from the sea were incorporated in
the calculations [29]. (Figure 2) In order to study the present and future effects of global

Climate change exposure: estimation of index P

Our first contribution is to estimate the recently proposed mosquito-borne viral suitability index, known as index P, for Mexico during 2000–2020. We estimate the recently proposed mosquito‑borne viral suitability index P, which measures the transmission potential of mosquito‑borne pathogens. This index mathematically models how humidity, temperature and precipitation affect the number of new infections generated by a single infected adult female mosquito in a host population. 

Our second contribution is to estimate the index P for the entire Mexican territory during 2000–2020 and present detailed graphical analysis of when the index P peaks regionally, focusing on 2010–2020

...we also pre-sent nine case studies across Mexico, in the north (Ciu-dad Mante, Mexicali, Monterrey), centre (Mexico City), southeast (Campeche, Tuxtla Gutiérrez), and coasts (Acapulco, Cancún, Coatzacoalcos). Overall, our analysis contributes to understanding the strength of correlation between the index P and mosquito-borne diseases, and the value of the index P for entomological surveillance and disease prevention
","The paper shows the dynamics of dengue, chikungunya and Zika in Mexico are strongly associated with seasonal climatological variability and the index P. This potential risk of transmission index, therefore, is a valuable tool for surveillance for mosquito‑borne diseases, particularly in settings with varied climates and limited entomologi‑cal capacity.

Our analysis offered two important insights. First, our analysis revealed the index P to be strongly correlated with the incidence of dengue, its peaks during the year and spatial distribution within the country. Second, this correlation was also high enough for chikungunya and Zika to serve as an additional surveillance tool for these diseases in as vast a country as Mexico. Thus, our analysis suggests the index P can serve as an additional tool for surveillance systems in the country and in settings that have limited entomological information, epidemiologi-cal capacity, and exposed to rapidly changing climatic conditions. It is only with detailed analysis like this that policymakers and researchers can unravel the extent to which changing climate conditions affect the spread of mosquito-borne diseases and act promptly.",This daily analysis allows us to assess the index’s sensitivity to seasonal changes in climate conditions. ,No,N/A,N/A,Timely information like this is vital to detect the highest viral transmission potential in each location and potential public health interventions to slow down the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses.,,No,,,,,

...we also pre-sent nine case studies across Mexico, in the north (Ciu-dad Mante, Mexicali, Monterrey), centre (Mexico City), southeast (Campeche, Tuxtla Gutiérrez), and coasts (Acapulco, Cancún, Coatzacoalcos). Overall, our analysis contributes to understanding the strength of correlation between the index P and mosquito-borne diseases, and the value of the index P for entomological surveillance and disease prevention
","The paper shows the dynamics of dengue, chikungunya and Zika in Mexico are strongly associated with seasonal climatological variability and the index P. This potential risk of transmission index, therefore, is a valuable tool for surveillance for mosquito‑borne diseases, particularly in settings with varied climates and limited entomologi‑cal capacity.

Our analysis offered two important insights. First, our analysis revealed the index P to be strongly correlated with the incidence of dengue, its peaks during the year and spatial distribution within the country. Second, this correlation was also high enough for chikungunya and Zika to serve as an additional surveillance tool for these diseases in as vast a country as Mexico. Thus, our analysis suggests the index P can serve as an additional tool for surveillance systems in the country and in settings that have limited entomological information, epidemiologi-cal capacity, and exposed to rapidly changing climatic conditions. It is only with detailed analysis like this that policymakers and researchers can unravel the extent to which changing climate conditions affect the spread of mosquito-borne diseases and act promptly.",This daily analysis allows us to assess the index’s sensitivity to seasonal changes in climate conditions. ,No,N/A,N/A,Timely information like this is vital to detect the highest viral transmission potential in each location and potential public health interventions to slow down the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses.,,No,,,,,

First, we obtained daily mean temperature series under scenarios of climate change consistent with the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) defined in the 2014 IPCC report.2 These four scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) correspond to increasing greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, and describe a range of changes in climate and related global warming, from mild (RCP2.6) to extreme (RCP8.5). We generated the temperature series under each RCP by general circulation models (GCMs), which offer a representation of past, current, and future climate dependent on greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, projections for five GCMs, representative of the range of available climate models, were developed and made available by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP).17 The ISI-MIP database provides daily mean temperature for his torical (1960–2005) and projected (2006–99) periods, bias-corrected and downscaled at a 0·5° × 0·5° spatial resolution, as single runs of each GCM under each RCP. 
We extracted the modelled daily temperature series for each of the studied locations in the period 1990–2099 by linking the coordinates with the corresponding cell of the grid, and recalibrated the modelled series using the observed series.18 We computed projected daily series of all-cause mortality as the average observed counts for each day of the year, repeated along the same projection period (1990–2099).",Mortality - general ," we obtained information from a dataset created through the Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Research Network. The dataset is composed of observed daily time series of mean temperature and mortality counts for all causes or non-external causes only (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes 0–799 in ICD-9 and codes A00-R99 in ICD-10) in largely overlapping periods ranging from Jan 1, 1984, to Dec 31, 2015, in addition to locationspecific meta-variables",Yes,"We obtained location-specific estimates of temperaturemortality associations from a two-stage time series analysis, as previously described.16 Briefly, in the first stage, we performed a quasi-Poisson regression separately in each location, controlling for season, long-term trends, and day of the week.

We computed the excess mortality attributable to temperature by projecting the impact using the modelled daily series of temperature and mortality under the assumption of no adaptation or population changes, extending a method previously illustrated.16 Briefly, for each location, we used the overall cumulative relative risk corresponding to each day’s temperature to compute the attributable deaths and fraction in the next 21 days, using the minimum mortality temperature, referred to as the optimal temperature, as the reference. The sum of the contributions from all the days of the series is interpreted as the total excess mortality attributed to non-optimal temperature, whereas the components attributable to cold and heat were separated by summing the subsets corresponding to days with temperatures lower or higher than the minimum mortality temperature, respectively (see appendix for an illustrative example). We first calculated the excess mortality separately for each location and combinations of GCMs and RCPs.

First, we obtained daily mean temperature series under scenarios of climate change consistent with the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) defined in the 2014 IPCC report.2 These four scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) correspond to increasing greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, and describe a range of changes in climate and related global warming, from mild (RCP2.6) to extreme (RCP8.5). We generated the temperature series under each RCP by general circulation models (GCMs), which offer a representation of past, current, and future climate dependent on greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, projections for five GCMs, representative of the range of available climate models, were developed and made available by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP).17 The ISI-MIP database provides daily mean temperature for his torical (1960–2005) and projected (2006–99) periods, bias-corrected and downscaled at a 0·5° × 0·5° spatial resolution, as single runs of each GCM under each RCP. 
We extracted the modelled daily temperature series for each of the studied locations in the period 1990–2099 by linking the coordinates with the corresponding cell of the grid, and recalibrated the modelled series using the observed series.18 We computed projected daily series of all-cause mortality as the average observed counts for each day of the year, repeated along the same projection period (1990–2099).",Mortality - general ," we obtained information from a dataset created through the Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Research Network.

",Yes,"SES - poor or marginalized populations; Other: Indegeneity, urban, rural, wealth, education","At age 0–1, the association with prenatal temperature and reduced HAZ is concentrated among children who are more socioeconomically advantaged. These include children who are non-indigenous (β = − 0.08, CI (− 0.15, − 0.015)), who live in urban areas (β = − 0.11, CI (− 0.17, − 0.06)), are wealthier (β for quintile 3 = − 0.17, CI (− 0.26, − 0.08)), and have higher maternal education (β for higher education = − 0.085, CI (− 0.17, − 0.0001)). At age 0–1, three-way interactions between rainfall and temperature, indigeneity, and urban/rural designation reveal that for non-indigenous urban-dwelling children, higher prenatal temperature is significantly associated (p < 0.01) with reduced HAZ (β = − 0.11, CI (− 0.17, − 0.04)). For indigenous urban-dwelling children, higher prenatal rainfall is associated with increased HAZ (β = 0.35, CI (0.02, 0.69)) but for indigenous rural-dwelling children, higher prenatal rainfall is associated with reduced HAZ (β = − 0.35, CI (− 0.67, − 0.03)).
By age 4–5, higher prenatal rainfall is weakly associated (p < 0.10) with reduced HAZ for non-indigenous children (β = − 0.03, CI (− 0.06, 0.001)). Higher prenatal rainfall is also associated with reduced HAZ for children in rural areas (β = −0.06, CI: (−0.10, −0.01)), in wealthier households (β for quintile 5 = − 0.08, CI (− 0.15, − 0.01)), and with higher maternal education (β for secondary education = − 0.06, CI (− 0.09, − 0.02)). By age 4–5, higher prenatal temperature is significantly associated with increased HAZ for children in higher-income households (βquintile 5 = 0.07, CI (0.023, 0.12) and indigenous urban­-dwelling children (β = 0.15, CI (0.014, 0.29)) and weakly associated with increased HAZ (p < 0.10) for kids with higher maternal education (β secondary education = 0.04, CI: (− 0.002, 0.09)). Higher cumulative postnatal rainfall by age 4–5 is significantly associated with increased HAZ among children considered socioeconomically advantaged. Children who are non-indigenous (β = 0.06, CI (0.012, 0.10)), live in urban areas (β = 0.07, CI (0.019, 0.12)), wealthier (β wealth quintile 5 = 0.17, CI: (0.086, 0.26)), and have higher maternal education (β higher education = 0.07, CI (− 0.003, 0.14)) all experience increased linear growth concurrent with higher postnatal rainfall. Higher cumulative postnatal temperature is associated with increased HAZ among non-indigenous children (β = 0.08, CI (0.03, 0.13)), urban children (β = 0.07, CI (0.012, 0.13)), and children in low-income households (β wealth quintile 1 = 0.11, CI (0.05, 0.17)). In three-way interactions with climate, indigeneity, and urban/rural, only non-indigenous urban-dwelling children have increased HAZ with elevated postnatal rainfall (β = 0.07, CI (0.018, 0.12)) and with elevated postnatal temperature (β = 0.08, CI (0.012, 0.14)).","These findings suggest that indigenous, rural children have experienced most of the negative health consequences and none of the benefits of rainfall anomalies. Climate change is expected to increase the range of weather anomalies globally. For Peru, with its topographic and climatic diversity, the long­term health consequences of climate change should be considered in future public health policymaking. Lastly, given the vulnerability of lower-resourced populations to climate anomalies, these public health policies may strengthen their effectiveness by targeting rural, indigenous communities.",N/A,No,Other: N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
